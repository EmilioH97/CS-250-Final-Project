# CS-250-Final-Project

•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I listen to clients about descriptions of when they describe the needs and wants of the product. The user stories use this information to add tasks to be completed based off priority and best interest of finished product. 

•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach development with a clear task to complete one at a time to ensure each step is done properly. I hope to incorporate scrum meetings and daily tasks into my future development to help me learn and improve throughout my career. 

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think a good team member is able to communicate well with one another and is open about struggles with development to the team.
